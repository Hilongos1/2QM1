        <h7> Creating a website is not easy, there's a possibility that it will not work. But my dedication in this course is as high of the star. I'll continue to make it happen, until my website will work. And my goal for this sem is to create a website that not only reflects my skills and knowledge as an IT Student but also pushes the bounderies of what is possible to happen. I want to expand my knowledge and skills to the best of me. I hope after this semester my website will work and stand out as my proof of my dedication to this wonderful journey and growth in the field of Technologies.  </h7>
